# Amazune Project

This project is my own rendition of Amazon. With creatable Users, Stores, and Items you can make your own user and add items to your cart with the click of a button. The application utilizes a Javascript frontend with a Rails API backend to retain data within the provided database.

Install: After cloning down the repository, run cd backend-api and bundle install && rails db:migrate && rails db:seed. Then cd front-end and npm i.
Finally to start the application for now and ever after use the executable located as backend-api/bin/start.

Contributions: If you would like to contribute, please open a pull request or let me know, I would love to have the feedback.
